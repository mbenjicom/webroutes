Why should we distrubute starter code for individual company apps?
	API boost (30%)
	Secure contracts through sales engineering work
	Sticky customers
	Our customers are interested in proprietary tools for competitive edge
	Licensing possiblity ($$$)
	
What is the risk?
	Legal can answer this question, but plan to ship the software as-is with no warranties

What exactly are we talking about?
	Novel ETL process (in progress)
		configuration: (endpoints to sync, rate to sync, flags to send)
		Auto-update schema based on swagger job
		detect hard deletes
		
	User based endpoint access through proxy (*/*, customer/*, */search, etc..)
	User based authentication keys
